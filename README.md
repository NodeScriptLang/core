## Core concepts

NodeScript employs [directed acyclic graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) as its main computation model.

Graphs are composed with nodes â€” atomics units of computations that can be linked together. Nodes are evaluated instantly, allowing one to immediately observe the results and reason about the data.
